<h1> Welcome, I am Marc-Aurèle Candela </h1>

<p>

If I had to describe myself in three words, I would say: communicative, curious and above all enthusiastic! I am a first year student in a business school and today, dynamism, rigour and versatility are my main assets to give the best of myself.
I have been able to develop these skills in my personal activities such as rock climbing and music, like playing violin, and then consolidate them in my school teaching and at the concervatory.

<h2>Violin</h2>

<p>

I am passionate about violin. I started when I was 7 or 8 years old and now I play the violin regularly and am a member of my conservatory orchestra. This allows me to play the violin with my friends and to travel, as I went to Germany for a show.

<h2>Cars</h2>

<p>

I've always been passionate about cars. I love looking at cars and especially driving them. Hearing the sound of the engine revving is the best symphony.

<h2>Travelling</h2>

<p>

I like travelling in my free time. I have not seen many coutries but I would love to go to more places with friends of family. I love reading books, they allow me to travel and disconnect from reality.
